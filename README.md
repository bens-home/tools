# Tools

A generic tools repo that I can throw some common scripts, configs, or other unrelated stuff in. 

## InstallCommonAptPackages

This will install any packages in the specified file (defaulting ot `packagesToInstall.txt`). Useful to run
on a fresh server to get all the common stuff that I use on ubuntu.
